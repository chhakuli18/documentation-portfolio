# Agile Process Overview
The Agile process is an iterative and collaborative approach to software development that focuses on delivering incremental value, adapting to change, and improving continuously. It enables teams to respond quickly to requirements, customer feedback, and project constraints while ensuring high-quality product delivery.

## Objectives of the Agile Process

- Deliver working software frequently and efficiently
- Improve collaboration between cross-functional teams
- Ensure transparency in development progress
- Reduce project risks through iterative cycles
- Provide flexibility for changing requirements

## Agile Roles and Responsibilities:

### Product Owner

- Defines product vision and goals
- Prioritizes the Product Backlog
- Clarifies requirements and user stories
- Represents customer needs

### Scrum Master

- Facilitates Agile ceremonies
- Removes blockers for the team
- Ensures adherence to Agile principles
- Supports continuous improvement

### Development Team

- Delivers potentially shippable increments
- Estimates tasks and user stories
- Participates in planning and retrospection
- Collaborates closely with other team members

## Agile Workflow
### Product Backlog Creation

The Product Owner creates and maintains a prioritized list of features, user stories, enhancements, and bugs. Each item includes acceptance criteria to define completion standards.

### Sprint Planning

- The team selects high-priority backlog items for the sprint
- User stories are broken down into tasks
- Estimations are provided (story points or hours)
- Sprint Goal is defined

### Sprint Execution

- During the sprint (typically 2–3 weeks):
- The team works on selected tasks
- Items move from To Do → In Progress → Review → Done
- The Scrum Master removes blockers
- Continuous integration & testing occurs

### Daily Stand-up Meeting

- A 15-minute discussion to sync the team:
- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- Are there any blockers?

### Sprint Review

- Demonstration of completed work
- Feedback gathered from stakeholders
- Product Backlog is updated based on inputs

### Sprint Retrospective

- Identify what went well
- Highlight improvement areas
- Define actionable steps for the next sprint

## Agile Artifacts
### Product Backlog

A dynamic, prioritized list of user stories and deliverables.

### Sprint Backlog

A set of tasks and user stories committed for a sprint.

### Increment

A working version of the product delivered at the end of each sprint.

## Tools Commonly Used

- Jira – Sprint management, backlog, user stories
- Confluence – Documentation and collaboration
- GitLab / GitHub / Bitbucket – Code versioning
- Slack / Teams – Communication
- Postman / Swagger – API validation and testing

## Benefits of Agile

- Faster delivery of features
- Early risk detection
- Continuous customer involvement
- Improved product quality
- Stronger team collaboration
- Flexibility to adapt to change

## Summary

The Agile process helps development teams deliver high-quality products efficiently through short iterations, continuous improvements, and strong collaboration. It provides a structured yet flexible framework suited for fast-paced and evolving business needs.
